**TEXTBOOK**: **Suggested**

- Speech and Language Processing, by Daniel Jurafsky and James Martin, 3rd Edition, 2020. Free online at https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/. 
- Introduction to Natural Language Processing, by Jacob Eisenstein, MIT Press, 2019 https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-natural-language-processing

## Course Description:

Introduction to concepts and techniques for automatically processing and understanding natural languages with computers; tokenziation; language models; machine learning approaches to natural language processing; neural language models; common tasks in NLP: information extraction, question answering, summarization, machine translation, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG); Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs). 

## Course organization and grades

The course involves the instructor's lectures and student presentations. The instructor will cover the basics of NLP. Students are required to complete a group or individual research project. An oral presentation of the term project is expected at the end of the semester. You are encouraged to pick a topic that would apply NLP in your research area.

- Presenting a recent milestone paper in the area of NLP: 50%
- Project: 50%

**FINAL GRADES**: Final grades will be given as follows, although the instructor retains the right to lower the grade thresholds at his discretion.

**A** 90%-100%  **B** 80%-89%  **C**70%-79%  **D** 60%-69%  **F** below 60%

## Free expression

Iowa State University supports and upholds the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech and
the principle of academic freedom in order to foster a learning environment where open inquiry and
the vigorous debate of a diversity of ideas are encouraged. Students will not be penalized for the
content or viewpoints of their speech as long as student expression in a class context is germane to
the subject matter of the class and conveyed in an appropriate manner.
