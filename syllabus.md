**OFFICE HOURS**: 14:40 to 15:40 Tuesdays and Thursdays, or by appointment 

**TEXTBOOK**: **Suggested**
- Speech and Language Processing, by Daniel Jurafsky and James Martin, 3rd Edition, 2020. Free online at https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/. 
- Introduction to Natural Language Processing, by Jacob Eisenstein, MIT Press, 2019 https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-natural-language-processing

## Course Description:

Introduction to concepts and techniques for automatically processing and understanding natural language with computers; language model; Part-of-Speech tagging; machine learning approaches to natural language processing; neural language models; selected applications in automatic speech recognition, information extraction, question answering, summarization, and machine translation; hands-on experience.

## Course organization and grades

The course involves the instructor's lectures and student presentations. The instructor will cover the basics of NLP. Students are required to complete a group or individual research project. An oral presentation of the term project is expected at the end of the semester. You are encouraged to pick a topic that would apply NLP in your research area.

- Presentating a recent milestone paper in the area of NLP: 70% (paper presentation can be susbstituted if the project is considered moderate or hard.)
- Project: 30%

**FINAL GRADES**: Final grades will be given as follows, although the instructor retains the right to lower the grade thresholds at his discretion.

**A** 90%-100%  **B** 80%-89%  **C**70%-79%  **D** 60%-69%  **F** below 60%

## COVID-19

Face masks encouraged: Because of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, all students are encouraged—but not required—to wear face masks, consistent with current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Further information on the proper use of face masks is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/effective-masks.html . 

Vaccinations encouraged:  All students are encouraged to receive a vaccination against COVID-19.  Multiple locations are available on campus for free, convenient vaccination. Further information is available at: https://web.iastate.edu/safety/updates/covid19/vaccinations . Vaccinations may also be obtained from health care providers and pharmacies.

Physical distancing encouraged for unvaccinated individuals:Classrooms and other campus spaces are operating at normal capacities, and physical distancing by faculty, staff, students, and visitors to campus is not required. However, unvaccinated individualsare encouraged to continue to physically distance themselves from others when possible.

## Free expression

Iowa State University supports and upholds the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech and
the principle of academic freedom in order to foster a learning environment where open inquiry and
the vigorous debate of a diversity of ideas are encouraged. Students will not be penalized for the
content or viewpoints of their speech as long as student expression in a class context is germane to
the subject matter of the class and conveyed in an appropriate manner.
