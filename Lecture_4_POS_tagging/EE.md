# Part of speech tagging

-   "In traditional grammar, a part of speech (abbreviated form: PoS or
    POS) is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items)
    which have similar grammatical properties. "

-   "In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or
    POST), also called grammatical tagging or word-category
    disambiguation, is the process of marking up a word in a text
    (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech,

-   based on both its definition and its context, i.e., its relationship
    with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or
    paragraph."

-   Brill tagger (circa. 1993): the first English POS tagger,
    rule-based. It assigns initial tags to words first and then use
    rules to iteratively update tags based on, e.g., context.

-   Brill tagger has hundreds of rules.

# Tags used in Penn Treebank

-   Nine common parts of speech in English: noun, verb, article,
    adjective, preposition, pronoun, adverb, conjunction, and
    interjection.

-   Most NLP researchers use Penn Treebank tags, which are finer than
    common English POSes mentioned above.

# Why do we still need POS tagging?

-   In DL era, models are end-to-end. Is POS tagging out of fashion?

-   There are still many cases where training data is not enough or
    labeling is very costly.

-   POS tags are a good intermediate feature, trained on large amounts
    of data.

-   The hidden states of POS taggers can be considered as a syntactical
    representation of text.

-   One way to look at POS tagging is to treate is an NP-Complete
    problem. It's a bridge.

-   What's new today in NLP? Adept AI.

# Probabilistic Model for Tagging

-   Problem of using rule-based system: Very difficult to verify and to
    scale.

-   Probabilistic approach: there are many sequences of tags, but only
    one yields (i.e., argmax) the highest probability.

# Probabilistic Model for Tagging

-   The goal is to find the most likely sequence of tags ($\mathbf{T}$),
    given the sequence of words ($\mathbf{W}$), i.e.,

    $$\mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}\limits_\mathbf{T}  P(\mathbf{T}|\mathbf{W})$$

# A generative model for POS tagging

-   Make use of Bayes' rule:

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}\limits_\mathbf{T}  P(\mathbf{T}|\mathbf{W}) &= \mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}\limits_\mathbf{T} \frac{P(\mathbf{W}|\mathbf{T}) P(\mathbf{T}) }{P(\mathbf{W})}  \\
           &= \mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}\limits_\mathbf{T} P(\mathbf{W}|\mathbf{T}) P(\mathbf{T}) \end{aligned}$$
    Note that we go from Eq. (1) to Eq. (2) because $P(\mathbf{W})$ is
    not a function of $\mathbf{T}$.

-   tag-to-tag *transition* probabilities:
    $P(\mathbf{T}) = \Pi_{i=1}^{l+1} P_T(t_i | t_{i-1})$: e.g.,

-   the probability of the first tag sequence:
    $P(\mathbf{T_1}) = P_T(JJ|\rhd) \times P_T(NN|JJ)   \times P_T(NN|NN)  \times \cdots$.

-   tag-to-word *emission* probabilities:
    $P(\mathbf{W}|\mathbf{T}) = \Pi_{i=1}^{l} P_E(w_i|t_i)$: e.g.,
    $P(\mathbf{W}|\mathbf{T_1}) = P_E(``natural''|JJ) \times P_E(``language''|NN)  \times P_E(``processing''|NN)   \times \cdots$.

# A generative model for POS tagging

-   A sequence of words is generated in two phases:

    1.  Produce a sequence of tags, e.g., $\rhd$, NN, DET, \..., based
        on probability between each two consecutive tags.

    2.  For each tag, produce a word, e.g., NN $\rightarrow$ "language",
        DT $\rightarrow$ "the".

-   Yes, a semantically meaningless sentence can be tagged and further
    parsed correctly, e.g., "NLP is a automobile of GOP".

# A generative model for POS tagging

-   The generative model we just see is a typical Hidden Markov Model
    (HMM), where a tag is a *state* and a word is an *observation*.

-   In each state/tag, a word/observation emits. After each emission,
    transit to the next state/tag and emit a word/observation again.

-   Why Markovian? The probably of a tag is only conditioned on the
    previous tag. No further history. First-order Markovian.

-   The transition and emission probabilities can be obtained by
    scanning the corpus once.

# A generative model for POS tagging

-   In principle, we just need to enumerate all possible tag sequences,
    $\mathbf{T}_1, \mathbf{T}_2, \dots$ and find the one that yields the
    largest $P(\mathbf{W}|\mathbf{T}) P(\mathbf{T})$.

-   But this is costly: If we have $N$ different tags and $l$ words in
    the sentence, there are $N^l$ possible/hidden tag sequences.

-   Smarter way? Viterbi algorithm -- a good example of dynamic
    programming.

# HMM decoding in Viterbi algorithm

-   The problem of estimating the sequence of hidden states given a
    sequence of observations is known as *decoding* in HMM.

-   Basic principle (Lemma 1): $\max(x\cdot y) = \max(x) \cdot y$, if
    $x$ is a real variable and $y$ is a real constant.

-   In each step $i$ (except the start and end), we have $N$ possible
    states/tags $t_i$'s, each of which can come from $N$ possible
    $t_{i-1}$'s.

# Viterbi algorithm in math induction

-   If the sentence has only one word: $\mathbf{W}= [w_1]$. The best tag
    $t_1$ should maximize $P_T(t_1|\rhd) P_E(w_1|t_1)$ where $\rhd=t_0$
    is the beginning of the sentence.

-   If it has two: $\mathbf{W}= [w_1, w_2]$. The best tags $t_1$ and
    $t_2$ shall maximize $\Pi_{i=1}^{2} P_T(t_i|t_{i-1}) P_E(w_i|t_i)$ =
    $P_T(t_1|\rhd) P_E(w_1|t_1)  P_T(t_2|t_1) P_E(w_2|t_2)$. Just search
    over the $N^2$ combinations of $t_1$ and $t_2$, time complexity
    $O(N^2)$.

-   If it has three: $\mathbf{W}= [w_1, w_2, w_3]$. , $$\begin{aligned}
        &  \max P_T(t_1|\rhd) P_E(w_1| t_1) P_T(t_2|t_1) P_E(w_2| t_2) & \overbrace{P_T(t_3|t_2) P_E(w_3| t_3)}^{\text{search only happens here}} \\
        = &  \left [   \max P_T(t_1|\rhd) P_E(w_1| t_1) P_T(t_2|t_1) P_E(w_2| t_2)  \right ]  & P_T(t_3|t_2) P_E(w_3| t_3)
        % \\
        % =  & ~~~~~~~~~~~~ v_{1,2}  &  P_T(t_3|t_2) P_E(w_3| t_3) 
        \end{aligned}$$

-   No need to check $N^3$ combinations of tags $t_1$, $t_2$ and $t_3$,
    many of which will not maximize the final number regardless of the
    value of $P_T(t_3|t_2) P_E(w_3| t_3)$. Instead, check
    $N + 2N^2 \in \mathcal{O}(3N^2)$ combinations.

# HMM decoding in Viterbi algorithm

-   Let's generalize: $$\begin{aligned}
      &  \max \Pi P_T(t_i|t_{i-1}) P_E(w_i| t_i) & P_T(t_{i+1}|t_i) P_E(w_{i+1}| t_{i+1}) \\
      = &  \left [  \max \Pi P_T(t_i|t_{i-1}) P_E(w_i| t_i) \right ] & P_T(t_{i+1}|t_i) P_E(w_{i+1}| t_{i+1})
      \end{aligned}$$

-   Denote
    $v(\overbrace{i}^{\text{step or word index}}, \overbrace{j}^{\text{state or tag index}})$
    as the probability that the HMM is in state $j$ after seeing the
    first $i$ observations and passing through **the most probable**
    preceding sequence of states. We call $v(i,j)$ the *previous Viterbi
    path probability*.

-   $$v(i,j) = \max_{j=1}^N v(i-1, j)P_T(t_i|t_j) P_E(w_i|t_i)$$

-   If we repeat this step by step, we can find the maximum
    $P(\mathbf{T}|\mathbf{W})$.

-   Then a traceback allows us to find the tags that maximizes it.

# HMM decoding in Viterbi algorithm

-   Time complexity: $O(lN^2)$ instead of $O(N^l)$ where $N$ is the
    number of tags and $l$ is the length of the sentence under
    POS-tagging.

-   For details, read chapter 9.4 of
    <https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/9.pdf>.

# What do you need?

-   A set of $N$ states/tags.

-   A set of $M$ obserations/words.

-   Transition probabilities, from one state/tag to another, usually as
    an $N\times N$ matrix

-   Emitting probabilities, from one state/tag to an obseration/word,
    usually as another matrix $N\times M$.

-   Initial state/tag probabilities, usually denoted as $pi$. But this
    can be easily resolved by introducing a origin state and the
    transition probabilities from the origin state to all other states.

# Computational problems

-   What is the problem of multiplying a lenghty list of probabilities?

-   Like gradient vanishing, the product becomes very very small.

-   Hence, a solution is to logarithmize all probabilities and use
    summation rather than multiplication.

-   See Neubig's slide 8 on HMM.
    <http://www.phontron.com/slides/nlp-programming-en-04-hmm.pdf>


# Conditional Random Fields

-   HMM uses Bayes theorem to find the most likely tag sequences
    $\mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}\limits_T P(\mathbf{T}|\mathbf{W})$.

-   CRFs directly estimates it.

-   It works by evaluting the chances of each tag sequence over all
    possible tag sequences in a softmax fashion:
    $$P(\mathbf{T}|\mathbf{W}) = 
        {
        {\exp \left (  \sum_{k=1}^K u_k F_k(\mathbf{W}, \mathbf{T})  \right ) }
        \over
        {\sum_{\mathcal{T'} \in \mathcal{T}}
        \exp \left (  \sum_{k=1}^K u_k F_k(\mathbf{W}, \mathbf{T'})  \right ) }
        }$$

-   Then just need to find
    $\mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}\limits_{T\in \mathcal{T}} P(T|W)$.

-   $u_k$ is the weight for the $k$-th feature $F_k$ which is a function
    of both word sequence and tag sequence.

-   Linear-chain CRF:
    $F_k(\mathcal{W}, \mathcal{T}) = \sum_{i=1}^l f_k(w_{i-1}, w_i, \mathcal{T}, i)$
    The sum of a function of the word sequence and only the current and
    previous tags.

# Features of using CRFs in POS tagging

-   Manually engineered features

-   See Â§8.5.1 of Jurafsky's book.

-   Also see
    <https://towardsdatascience.com/pos-tagging-using-crfs-ea430c5fb78b>

-   It's now even common to use DL to extract features and then hook up
    to CRF, e.g., BiLSTM-CRF (NAACL 2016)
    <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.01991.pdf>

# Named Entity Recognition (NER)

-   NEs are proper nouns. It is not rare for them to contain more than
    one word, e.g., New York City.

-   Common categories of NEs: organization, people, location, etc.

-   Just like POS tagging, NER can be modeled as a tagging problem.

-   Instead of deciding the POS tags, we decide a different kind of
    tags.

-   A common type of tags used in NER is BIO: begin, inside, and
    outside. See
    <https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/bio-tagged-text-to-original-text-99b05da6664>

-   See also
    <https://github.com/scofield7419/sequence-labeling-BiLSTM-CRF>

-   It seems that CRF is more widely used in NER than in POS tagging.

# Modern ways? 

Neural network-based generative models, e.g., seq2seq.
